## Code Standards

* Keep the styling simple.
* Use 4 spaces for indentation.
* Put each selector on it's own line ending in either a comma or brace.
* Use dashes to separate multi-word selectors instead of camel case.
* Element ordering
    * display (position, float, clear, display)
    * positioning (width, height, margin, padding)
    * box model (color, background, border, box-shadow)
    * colors and typography (font-size, font-family, text-align)
    * other (cursor, overflow, z-index)
* Use one space after each colon.
